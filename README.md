# MfeatheRSS

Since IFTTT stopped supporting twitter triggers, the [Feathers-GeePaw](http://feathersgeepaw.tumblr.com/) tumblr stopped updating.

This is a workaround for now that uses twitter's depricated RSS feed api -> trims it to a feed IFTTT can it -> IFTTTs it to tumblr

Currently only barely supports tweets from mfeathers at geepawhill
