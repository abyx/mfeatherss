# MfeatheRSS

Since IFTTT stopped supporting twitter triggers, the [Feathers-GeePaw](http://feathersgeepaw.tumblr.com/) tumblr stopped updating.

This is a workaround for now that uses my own site that hosts a twitter app and exports mfeathers's tweets as RSS which I then use with IFTTT to create tumblr posts.

Currently only barely supports tweets from mfeathers at geepawhill
